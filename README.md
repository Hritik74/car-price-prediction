# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is focused on predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. It involves data analysis, model training, and prediction of the prices of various car models.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available in the 'Cleaned Car.csv' directory. It includes information about various car features such as car name, company, year, Price, kms_driven,	fuel_type.

## Models

We have trained and included models in the 'LinearRegressionModel.pkl' directory.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Web application for car price prediction

## Results

In the model evaluation phase, we achieved impressive accuracy and performance metrics. The models, trained on the provided dataset, demonstrated robust predictive capabilities. 
Additionally, we have incorporated insightful visualizations to better understand the underlying patterns in the data.
Furthermore, the trained models are capable of predicting car prices based on the features provided.
